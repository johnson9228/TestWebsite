    <h1>ME! (lyrics)</h1>
    <h2>Taylor Swift</h2>
    <p>I promise that you'll never find another like me</p>
    <p>I know that I'm a handful, baby, uh
        I know I never think before I jump
        And you're the kind of guy the ladies want
        (And there's a lot of cool chicks out there)
        I know that I went psycho on the phone
        I never leave well enough alone
        And trouble's gonna follow where I go
        (And there's a lot of cool chicks out there)</p>
    <p>But one of these things is not like the others
        Like a rainbow with all of the colors
        Baby doll, when it comes to a lover
        I promise that you'll never find another like</p>
    <p>Me-e-e, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
        I'm the only one of me
        Baby, that's the fun of me
        Eeh-eeh-eeh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
        You're the only one of you
        Baby, that's the fun of you
        And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me-e-e</p>
    <p>I know I tend to make it about me
        I know you never get just what you see
        But I will never bore you, baby
        (And there's a lot of lame guys out there)
        And when we had that fight out in the rain
        You ran after me and called my name
        I never wanna see you walk away
        (And there's a lot of lame guys out there)</p>
    <p>'Cause one of these things is not like the others
        Livin' in winter, I am your summer
        Baby doll, when it comes to a lover
        I promise that you'll never find another like
        </p>
    <p>Me-e-e, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
        I'm the only one of me
        Let me keep you company
        Eeh-eeh-eeh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
        You're the only one of you
        Baby, that's the fun of you
        And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me-e-e</p>
